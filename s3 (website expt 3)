Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî this is another classic AWS practical that tests your understanding of **S3 as a static website host**.
Let‚Äôs keep it **short, simple, step-wise**, and **exam-ready**, with small explanations alongside.

---

## üß© **Aim:**

To study AWS S3 service and create a bucket for hosting a static web application.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Steps**

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Create an S3 Bucket**

* Go to **S3 ‚Üí Create bucket**
* **Bucket name:** e.g. `my-static-web-bucket`
*ENABLE ACL OR CHANGE BUCKET POLICY (VIA CODE) TO DO IT W/O ENABLING ACL
* **Region:** choose nearest one (e.g. `ap-south-1`)
* Uncheck **Block all public access** ‚Üí Confirm the warning.
  *(Website hosting requires public read access.)*
* Click **Create bucket**

üß† *S3 bucket acts like a web server where HTML, CSS, and JS files are stored.*

---

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Upload Website Files**

* Open your new bucket ‚Üí **Upload**
* Upload a simple `index.html` file (and optionally `style.css`, `script.js`).

**Example `index.html`:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>My Static Website</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from AWS S3!</h1>
    <p>This is my static web app hosted on S3.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

### **Step 3 ‚Äì Enable Static Website Hosting**

* Inside the bucket ‚Üí **Properties tab**
* Scroll to **Static website hosting** ‚Üí **Edit**
* Select **Enable**
* Hosting type: *Host a static website*
* Index document: `index.html`
* Save changes

üß† *This tells AWS to serve your files through a public website endpoint.*

---

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Make Files Public**

* Go to **Objects tab ‚Üí Select all ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Make public**
  *(or edit bucket policy manually to allow public read access)*

üß† *Public access is needed so anyone can open your website without credentials.*

---

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Access the Website**

* Go to **Properties ‚Üí Static website hosting section**
* Copy the **Bucket website endpoint URL** (e.g.
  `http://my-static-web-bucket.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`)
* Open it in a browser ‚Üí You‚Äôll see your webpage üéâ

---

### **Step 6 ‚Äì Result**

> Successfully hosted a static web application using AWS S3.
> The website can be accessed publicly using the S3 website endpoint URL.

---

### üß† **Theory Summary (for viva/lab record)**

* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is object storage for data, files, and web assets.
* It can serve static files directly using **Static Website Hosting** feature.
* S3 acts like a simple web server for static content (no backend processing).

Would you like me to give you a **ready-made HTML + CSS mini webpage** (simple but nice looking) that you can directly upload for your practical?
